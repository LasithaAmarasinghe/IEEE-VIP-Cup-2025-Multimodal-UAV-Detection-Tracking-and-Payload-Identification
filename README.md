# IEEE Signal Processing Society Drone Detection Challenge

## Project Overview
This repository contains our team's solution for the IEEE Signal Processing Society Drone Detection Challenge for ICIP 2025. Our approach utilizes multimodal fusion of RGB and IR imaging data to detect, track, and classify drones and their payloads in various challenging environmental conditions.

## Challenge Description
The challenge focuses on three main tasks:
1. **RGB + IR Drone Detection**: Distinguishing drones from birds using both visual and thermal imaging
2. **RGB + IR Drone Tracking**: Tracking drone trajectories and determining approach/recession patterns
3. **Payload Detection**: Identifying whether drones are carrying harmful or normal payloads
